# Telecom Sector Loan Prediction.

### USE CASE :
_Many donors, experts, and microfinance institutions (MFI) have become convinced that using mobile financial services (MFS) is more convenient and efficient, and less costly, than the traditional high-touch model for delivering microfinance services. MFS becomes especially useful when targeting the unbanked poor living in remote areas. The implementation of MFS, though, has been uneven with both significant challenges and successes._

_Today, microfinance is widely accepted as a poverty-reduction tool, representing 70 billion in outstanding loans and a global outreach of 200 million clients._

_One of our Client in Telecom collaborates with an MFI to provide micro-credit on mobile balances to be paid back in 5 days. The Consumer is believed to be delinquent if he deviates from the path of paying back the loaned amount within 5 days._
